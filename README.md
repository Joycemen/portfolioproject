# Portfolio Project
This repository contains two projects: a Quote Generator and a Login Form. These projects are part of my portfolio and demonstrate my skills in web development. The project uses javascript to change the color of some links with mouse pointers.
## Quote Generator
The Quote Generator is a simple web application that generates random quotes. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application fetches quotes from an html page and displays them to the user as seen in the images folder. This project showcases my ability to manipulate data using JavaScript.

## Login Form
The Login Form project is a basic web form for user authentication. It is built using HTML and CSS, with potential for backend integration. The form includes fields for email address and password, and demonstrates my understanding of front-end web development and user interface design, which can be integrated with backend functionality.
